## Material Database

**Built-in Materials**
*   Common sheet goods with standard dimensions
*   Plywood, MDF, particleboard, and solid wood panels
*   Standard thicknesses from 3mm to 50mm
*   Metric and imperial sizing options

**Custom Materials**
*   Add materials specific to your suppliers
*   Configure non-standard dimensions and properties
*   Set regional pricing and availability
*   Create material families for related products

## Adding New Materials

**Basic Information**
*   Material Name: Clear, descriptive identifier
*   Category: Group similar materials together
*   Supplier: Source information for ordering
*   SKU/Part Number: Supplier identification codes

**Physical Properties**
*   Width: Sheet width in model units
*   Height: Sheet height in model units  
*   Thickness: Material thickness for component matching
*   Density: Weight per unit volume (optional)

**Pricing Information**
*   Base Price: Cost per sheet before discounts
*   Quantity Breaks: Volume pricing tiers
*   Waste Factor: Percentage allowance for unusable material
*   Handling Costs: Additional fees for processing or delivery

## Material Categories

**Standard Categories**
*   Plywood: Various grades and species
*   MDF: Medium-density fiberboard products
*   Particleboard: Engineered wood panels
*   Solid Wood: Natural lumber panels
*   Specialty: Unique or composite materials

**Custom Categories**
*   Create categories for specific workflows
*   Organize by supplier or project type
*   Group by thickness or finish requirements
*   Separate structural and decorative materials

## Material Properties

**Grain Direction**
*   Specify if parts must align with wood grain
*   Set preferred orientation for strength requirements
*   Configure rotation restrictions for veneer matching
*   Account for expansion and contraction characteristics

**Surface Characteristics**
*   Finish Requirements: Raw, pre-finished, or textured
*   Edge Banding: Matching or contrasting edge treatments
*   Lamination: Single or multi-layer construction
*   Quality Grades: A, B, C grades for different applications

**Working Properties**
*   Machinability: Ease of cutting and shaping
*   Stability: Resistance to warping and movement
*   Durability: Expected lifespan in application
*   Special Requirements: Moisture resistance, fire rating

## Pricing Management

**Cost Structure**
*   Base Material Cost: Raw material price per sheet
*   Processing Fees: Cutting, edge banding, finishing
*   Delivery Charges: Transportation and handling costs
*   Markup Percentages: Profit margins and overhead

**Dynamic Pricing**
*   Quantity Discounts: Automatic price breaks for volume
*   Seasonal Adjustments: Price variations by time of year
*   Supplier Promotions: Temporary pricing incentives
*   Currency Conversion: Multi-currency support for imports

**Cost Analysis**
*   Material Utilization: Efficiency percentages and waste costs
*   Comparative Analysis: Cost per square foot across materials
*   Project Budgeting: Total material costs with alternatives
*   Profitability Reports: Margin analysis by material type

## Material Assignment

**Automatic Detection**
*   Thickness Matching: Components assigned by thickness
*   Material Attributes: SketchUp materials mapped to stock
*   Component Names: Pattern matching for automatic assignment
*   Layer/Tag Association: Organize by SketchUp organizational tools

**Manual Assignment**
*   Override automatic assignments when needed
*   Specify premium materials for visible components
*   Assign structural materials for hidden elements
*   Configure mixed-material assemblies

**Validation Rules**
*   Thickness Compatibility: Ensure components fit material thickness
*   Dimension Limits: Verify parts fit within sheet dimensions
*   Quantity Availability: Check stock levels against requirements
*   Cost Constraints: Alert when exceeding budget parameters

## Material Optimization

**Efficiency Strategies**
*   Prefer materials with better utilization rates
*   Minimize the number of different materials used
*   Optimize sheet sizes for typical part dimensions
*   Consider grain direction impact on waste

**Waste Reduction**
*   Identify reusable offcuts for future projects
*   Suggest alternative materials with better efficiency
*   Optimize part orientation and spacing
*   Account for standard cutting patterns

**Cost Optimization**
*   Compare material alternatives for cost savings
*   Suggest quantity breaks and bulk purchasing
*   Identify opportunities for material substitution
*   Calculate total project costs including waste

## Supplier Integration

**Supplier Database**
*   Contact Information: Names, addresses, phone numbers
*   Product Catalogs: Available materials and specifications
*   Pricing Agreements: Negotiated rates and terms
*   Delivery Options: Lead times and shipping methods

**Ordering Integration**
*   Generate purchase orders from cut lists
*   Export material requirements in supplier formats
*   Track order status and delivery schedules
*   Manage inventory levels and reorder points

**Quality Management**
*   Supplier Performance: Track quality and delivery metrics
*   Material Specifications: Maintain detailed product data
*   Inspection Requirements: Quality control procedures
*   Return Policies: Procedures for defective materials
