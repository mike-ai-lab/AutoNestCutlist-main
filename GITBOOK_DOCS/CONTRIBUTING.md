## Reporting Issues

> [!NOTE]
> When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and fix it quickly.

*   Open a new issue on the [repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/your-repo/autonestcut/issues) (replace with actual link).
*   Provide a concise description of the problem.
*   List clear steps to reproduce the issue.
*   Include example model files or screenshots when relevant and possible.

## Code Contributions

> [!TIP]
> Keep your pull requests focused on a single feature or fix to streamline the review process.

1.  **Fork** the AutoNestCut repository.
2.  **Create a new feature branch** from `main` (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature` or `fix/my-bug-fix`).
3.  **Implement your changes**, adhering to existing code style.
4.  **Write tests** for your changes where feasible.
5.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the original repository.
    *   Describe your changes clearly.
    *   Reference any related issues.

## Documentation Improvements

We appreciate contributions to our documentation!

*   Improve existing content or translate documentation files located in the `docs/` folder (or `example/docs/` as mentioned in the original file, I'll assume `docs/` for the final structure).
*   Submit a Pull Request with your proposed changes.

## Media and Examples

If you're adding images to the documentation:

*   Upload the images to the project's media repository or CDN (e.g., `https://media.example.com/mike-ai-lab/cutlist`).
*   Reference them in the Markdown using the `{{IMAGE_BASE}}` placeholder.
    *   Example: `![Alt text]({{IMAGE_BASE}}/my_image.jpg)`
*   For local development and fallbacks, include a local copy of the image in the `docs/` folder or a suitable `media/` subfolder within `docs/`.
