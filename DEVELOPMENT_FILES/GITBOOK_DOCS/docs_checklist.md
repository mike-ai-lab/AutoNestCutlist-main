Documentation Inaccuracies Report
❌ MAJOR INACCURACIES:
System Requirements - Operating System Support

Documentation Claims: "Windows 10 or later", "Windows Server 2016 or later"

Reality: No OS-specific code found, should work on macOS/Linux too

Issue: Overly restrictive, misleading users

Export Formats - Image Exports

Documentation Claims: "Image exports for documentation"

Reality: Only PDF, CSV, and HTML exports implemented

Issue: No image export functionality exists

Material Database - Built-in Materials

Documentation Claims: "Built-in materials with standard dimensions", "Common sheet goods with standard dimensions"

Reality: Only basic material structure, no pre-populated database

Issue: Users expect pre-loaded materials

Advanced Features - Multiple Optimization Strategies

Documentation Claims: "Multiple optimization strategies available"

Reality: Single nesting algorithm implementation

Issue: No algorithm selection options

Configuration - Nesting Algorithm Parameters

Documentation Claims: "Optimization Level: Balance between speed and efficiency", "Iteration Count: Number of placement attempts per part"

Reality: No such configuration options in UI or code

Issue: Advanced settings don't exist

❌ MODERATE INACCURACIES:
Performance Specifications

Documentation Claims: "Optimized for models with up to 1000 components"

Reality: No performance limits or optimization code found

Issue: Unsubstantiated performance claims

Material Properties - Grain Direction

Documentation Claims: Extensive grain direction features

Reality: Basic grain direction detection, limited configuration

Issue: Overstated capabilities

Supplier Integration

Documentation Claims: "Generate purchase orders from cut lists", "Track order status"

Reality: No supplier integration features implemented

Issue: Non-existent functionality described

Project Templates

Documentation Claims: "Reusable project configurations", "Template Creation"

Reality: No template system implemented

Issue: Missing workflow feature

❌ MINOR INACCURACIES:
Licensing - Offline Activation

Documentation Claims: "Offline activation available"

Reality: License system exists but offline activation unclear

Issue: May not be fully implemented

File Format Support

Documentation Claims: "Works with imported geometry from other CAD systems"

Reality: Standard SketchUp component support only

Issue: Overstated compatibility

📝 RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove claims about image exports

Clarify OS compatibility (not Windows-only)

Remove advanced algorithm options from docs

Remove supplier integration features

Simplify material database claims

Remove template system references

Clarify actual performance capabilities

Focus documentation on implemented features only
