## Data Interpretation

**Efficiency Analysis**
*   Material utilization above 85% is excellent
*   70-85% utilization is good for complex projects
*   Below 70% suggests optimization opportunities
*   Consider alternative materials or part sizing

**Cost Validation**
*   Compare calculated costs with estimates
*   Verify pricing accuracy and currency
*   Check for quantity break opportunities
*   Validate waste factor assumptions

**Quality Metrics**
*   Review part placement for cutting practicality
*   Check spacing adequacy for your cutting methods
*   Verify grain direction compliance
*   Confirm dimensional accuracy requirements

## Report Distribution

**Internal Use**
*   Production planning and scheduling

*   Change order documentation
*   Final project documentation

**Supplier Coordination**
*   Material specifications and quantities
*   Delivery scheduling and logistics
*   Quality requirements and standards
*   Purchase order generation and tracking

## Troubleshooting Reports

**Common Issues**
*   Missing parts: Check selection and component definitions
*   Incorrect dimensions: Verify model units and scaling
*   Poor efficiency: Review material sizes and part orientation
*   Cost discrepancies: Validate pricing and waste factors

**Quality Checks**
*   Cross-reference part counts with model
*   Verify material assignments are correct
*   Check cutting diagram practicality
