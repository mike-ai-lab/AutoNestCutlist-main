# Basic Workflow

Complete workflow guide for using AutoNestCut from model preparation to final export.

---

## Overview

AutoNestCut follows a structured workflow designed for efficiency and accuracy. Understanding this process ensures optimal results for your projects.

## Phase 1: Model Preparation

**Component Creation**
*   Model each part as a separate SketchUp component
*   Use descriptive names (e.g., "Door_Panel_600x400", "Shelf_Standard")
*   Ensure realistic dimensions and thickness (3-50mm for sheet goods)
*   Apply materials consistently across similar parts

**Model Organization**
*   Group related components into assemblies
*   Use layers or tags for different material types
*   Maintain clean geometry without overlapping faces
*   Position components logically in 3D space

**Quality Checks**
*   Verify component origins are properly set
*   Check for solid geometry (no gaps or reversed faces)
*   Ensure thickness values are realistic for your materials
*   Test component definitions are unique where needed

## Phase 2: Selection Strategy

**Selective Processing**
*   Select only components needed for current cut list
*   Use Ctrl+click for multiple non-adjacent selections
*   Consider processing by material type or project phase
*   Avoid selecting entire complex assemblies unnecessarily

**Performance Optimization**
*   Process 50-200 components per session for best performance
*   Break large projects into logical batches
*   Select components at the top level of hierarchy
*   Exclude non-sheet-good components from selection

## Phase 3: Configuration

**General Settings**
*   Set kerf width based on your cutting method (2-4mm typical)
*   Enable rotation unless grain direction is critical
*   Configure part labeling preferences
*   Set measurement units to match your workflow

**Material Setup**
*   Add stock materials with accurate dimensions
*   Include realistic pricing for cost analysis
*   Configure waste percentages and handling costs
*   Set up material categories for organization

**Advanced Options**
*   Adjust nesting algorithm parameters
*   Configure export file naming conventions
*   Set default project information fields
*   Customize report layout preferences

## Phase 4: Processing

**Generation Process**
*   Review detected parts in preview panel
*   Verify material assignments are correct
*   Check part dimensions and quantities
*   Start cut list generation

**Monitoring Progress**
*   Watch processing status indicators
*   Review any warnings or errors
*   Check memory usage for large projects
*   Allow sufficient time for complex nesting

**Quality Review**
*   Examine generated cutting diagrams
*   Verify part placement and orientation
*   Check material utilization efficiency
*   Review cost calculations and totals

## Phase 5: Report Analysis

**Diagram Review**
*   Check cutting layouts for practicality
*   Verify part labels and dimensions
*   Ensure adequate spacing between parts
*   Confirm grain direction where applicable

**Data Validation**
*   Review part quantities and totals
*   Check material requirements and costs
*   Verify efficiency percentages
*   Validate export format compatibility

**Project Documentation**
*   Add project name and description
*   Include client information and date
*   Add special cutting instructions
*   Note any material specifications

## Phase 6: Export and Distribution

**Format Selection**
*   PDF for workshop printing and documentation
*   CSV for inventory management and purchasing
*   HTML for client presentations and sharing
*   Choose appropriate file naming conventions

**Quality Control**
*   Test exported files open correctly
*   Verify all diagrams are complete and readable
*   Check data integrity in spreadsheet exports
*   Confirm file sizes are reasonable for sharing

**Distribution**
*   Share appropriate formats with team members
*   Archive project files for future reference
*   Update material inventory systems
*   Communicate any special requirements to production

## Best Practices

**Model Preparation**
*   Use consistent naming conventions
*   Keep component definitions clean and organized
*   Apply materials at the component level
*   Maintain realistic proportions and dimensions

**Processing Efficiency**
*   Process similar materials together
*   Use appropriate batch sizes for your hardware
*   Save project files before major processing runs
*   Keep SketchUp models optimized and clean

**Quality Assurance**
*   Always review results before finalizing
*   Cross-check critical dimensions manually
*   Verify material calculations against estimates
*   Test cut files with small samples when possible
